    "#### **The Scenario and Purpose**\n",
    "##### My chosen scenario is the cost of using a car, which is based on many factors including current price, fuel type, seller type and transmission. With this dataset, I can analyse the data to find out what factors are influencing the cost of different models of cars spread across different dates. The data is accessible publicly on Kaggle, and can be downloaded as a CSV. I will analyse the data in its CSV format. \n",

    "#### **Data Loading**\n",
    "##### To ensure the data is suitable for analysis, the dataset needs to be imported as an appropiate file format. The dataset for analysis would be in a CSV format.\n",
    " * The user will need to **input** an appropiate file format (CSV, preferrably).\n",
    " * There wouldn't be an **output**, but to ensure the file can be read with Pandas, the CSV must have accurate data placement in regards with commas, to make sure rows and columns are readable to the computer.\n",
    "#### **Data Cleaning** \n",
    "##### The system also needs to be able to allow filtering, sorting and grouping to enable successful analysis. The dataset also needs to be \"organised\" in a way that removes incorrect or invalid pieces of data before the analysis occurs, to ensure accurate results.\n",
    " * The **user** will need to either run a process that uses Pandas to filter data, or they can use a spreadsheet program, such as Excel, and utilise it to filter out the invalid information.\n",
    " * The program should be able to **output** a correct and clean dataset. \n",
    "#### **Data Analysis**\n",
    "##### The statistical analysis needs to conduct a variety of different processes to output useful results. These process include the mean, median and mode for various columns in the dataset, such as mileage and price. However, mean and median may only be able to be analysed for numerical data. For non-numerical data, most frequent and infrequent values can also be analysed.\n",
    " * The **user** will need to run a program where it is capable of analysing data. \n",
    " * The program will need to **output** the necessary analysis results requested by the user. It may be sorted into variables into a dataset.\n",
    "#### **Data Visualisation**\n",
    "##### The data will be visualised mainly through Matplotlib graphs. With the use of dataframes (another method of visualisation) and datasets to store data, graphs can be created as an easy and consumable method of visualising large amounts of the data.\n",
    " * The **user** will need to specify what kind of graph through the Matplotlib module. They may also request a table of summary.\n",
    " * The program will need to **output** the specified graph or table.\n",
    "#### **Data Reporting**\n",
    "##### The system will need to create some statistical information relating to the dataset (quantity of rows, columns, mean, etc.) will also be a part of the output results, as an extra summary of the information. Data reporting can also be outside of the program, where written reports can be created based on the information gathered fro the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " * The **user** will need to request statistical information from the program.\n",
    " * The program will need to **output** the requested statistical information, making sure it is correct/valid. "

It should also be easy to navigate to different tasks, making seamless user experience. Having a user-interface also makes it easier for the user to understand how to perform different tasks, without having to spend an excessive amount of time trying to figure out how to do a certain task. A **READ ME** document is also very helpful, as it provides the user with some context, background information, and even instructions on how to use the program or UI. A README document should contain background information, instructions, support, and even some legal information if needed.\n",
    "##### **Reliability**\n",
    "##### When errors are found, the system should give some technical information about the error, as well as suggesting some solutions on resolving the error. The technical information is important as it gives an idea of where the error may be found. These reliability factors are essential when the system needs to give information about an error.\n"

    "##### My chosen dataset was sourced fromm Kaggle. Kaggle, as a host for datasets and machine-learning, has multiple responsibilities when it comes to protecting participants' and users' privacy. One of the most important data to protect is account data, whether they are passwords, emails or contact information. This collection of data should be minimised incase of potential data breaches. Kaggle must also keep usage data private and minimised as much as possible. It includes documenting activity and actions on the platform. As a platform that is responsible for holding sensitive information, Kaggle must also be transparent about their collection practices to their users and participants, so that they are well informed on what they may be revealing about their personal information,\n",

    "##### My responsibilites for maintaining the privacy of this dataset mainly revolve around participants who gave their information in the creation of this data. Some data is identifiable, if it reveals information about who actually gave it away. If I were to push this application to the public, I'll ensure all information is kept relevant to its use, while remaining transparent about collected user data and minimise it.\n",
    "#### **Cyber Security**\n",
    "##### To maintain cyber security in an application, its important to protect sensitive information. Firstly, an application should have a secure login process (if needed), which ensures the user to have a strong password, and even multi-factor authentication to add bonus layers of security. Data should allso be encrypted, to keep out unauthorized access. Applications should have constant monitering of activity within its servers and programs, to detect suspicious or dangerous activity early. Lastly, developers and managers of applications should regularly update their security practices, ensuring it is up to date with as little potential errors as possible, maintaining security of the data. These are all essential cybersecurity features within applications.\n",
    "* #### **User Authentication:** A process that verifies a user's identity, granting access to online applications or other resources.\n",
    "* #### **Password Hashing:** A security action that turns a password into a string of letters and numbers using an encyption algorithm, to ensure a secure password.\n",
    "* #### **Encryption:** A form of data security in which information is converted into ciphertext. Only authorized users are able to decipher the encrypted information to obtain the original plaintext."
