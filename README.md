# Data-Analysis-Cars
Data analysis and dataset for cars.

Instructions:
1. Ensure the CSV has been loaded correctly. You can either run the program, or check for the file 'cardata.csv'. If there is an error, ensure Pandas and Matplotlib is installed on your system, or check if the CSV is in the 'data' folder.
2. Run the program.
3. Select one of the options to analyse the data.
4. After finishing the analysis, quit the program. There is already an option to quit in the UI.
Note: After quitting, you may need to load a new terminal to run it again.

Side notes:
- The UI has already converted lakh INR into AUD. 
- If you want to view it in lakh INR, you can simply convert 'conversion_rate = 100000 * 0.018' into 'conversion_rate = 1'.
- The data charts showcasing 'Sellling Price' and 'Current Price' however, are still in the same currency of **lakh INR**. 

**PLEASE PLEASE IGNORE get-pip.py! It is not part of the program in any way.**
